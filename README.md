OpenGL program that designs a logo, displays temperature using bars, and  draws the sketch of square loops

Work on the three tasks:

1- Hasan Kalyoncu University announced a competition for new HKU logo design. Write an OpenGL
program that designs new HKU logo. The LOGO must be meaningful, colorful, and realistic.

2- Do one of the two tasks:
a. Write an OpenGL program that reads the temperatures every one hour over a full day,
and then display them using bars. Write under each bar the number of the hour (am,
pm, or 24 base). Bars have different colors for day and nights hours.
b. Write an OpenGL program that draw polynomial function. The program asks the user to
enter the degree and the parameters of the function. Then, it draws the function over a
suitable range.

3- Write an OpenGL program that draws the sketch :
The sketch contains a N squares (variable) with descending sizes. The corners of the next
squares start from the middle point of the edge of the previous square. Squares are filled with
different colors. The program ask the user to enter the number of squares N
